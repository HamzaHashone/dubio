2. Create a free account

### 2. Configure Email Service
1. In EmailJS dashboard, go to "Email Services"
2. Add a new service (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
3. Note down the Service ID

### 3. Create Email Template
1. Go to "Email Templates" in EmailJS dashboard
2. Create a new template with the following variables:
   - `{{user_email}}` - The user's email address
   - `{{to_name}}` - Recipient name (Dubio Team)
   - `{{from_name}}` - Sender name (user's email)
   - `{{message}}` - Custom message about waitlist signup

Example template:
```
Subject: New Waitlist Signup - Dubio
